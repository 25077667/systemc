1) What's changed in this kit?
==============================

Compared to the 29 Nov 2006 draft 1 kit, draft 2 has evolved in the following
primary ways:
  - Many of the features have undergone significant change:
    - Untimed modeling
    - Loosely timed modeling
    - Approximately timed modeling
    - The generic payload and its extension mechanism
    - Non-intrusive (debug) transactions
  - Several new features have been incorporated:
    - Temporal decoupling
    - Model synchronization
    - Direct memory interface (DMI)
  - Documentation (users manual) is provided
  - Examples have been improved

2) Areas under construction
===========================

This is a draft kit for public review so any of it is subject to change.  
During the public review, there will be ongoing work to improve the 
documentation and provide more examples.  Some of the planned investigations
are:
  - improve the analysis ports and integrate them with sockets
  - extend DMI to support snooping and consider a direct channel for bus
    bypass to non-memory models
  - enforce payload modifiability rules
