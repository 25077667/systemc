1) Supported SystemC versions
=============================
SystemC 2.1.v1 and 2.2.0 are supported and have been tested.

2) What's changed in this kit?
==============================

Compared to the 29 Nov 2006 draft 1 kit, draft 2 has evolved in the following
primary ways:
  - Many of the features have undergone significant change:
    - Untimed modeling
    - Approximately timed modeling
    - The generic payload and its extension mechanism
    - Non-intrusive (debug) transactions
  - Several new features have been incorporated:
    - Loosely timed modeling
    - Temporal decoupling
    - Model synchronization
    - Direct memory interface (DMI)
  - Documentation (training presentation and users manual) is provided
  - Examples have been improved

3) Areas under construction
===========================

This is a draft kit for public review so any of it is subject to change.  
During the public review, there will be ongoing work to improve the 
documentation and provide more examples.  Some of the planned investigations
are:
  - consider generic payload support for atomic transactions
  - improve the analysis ports and integrate them with sockets
  - extend DMI to support snooping and consider a direct channel for bus
    bypass to non-memory models
  - enforce payload modifiability rules
  - some features of the generic payload need to be programmed differently 
    depending on host endianness; helper functions will be provided to isolate
    the modeler from these details; key issues are demonstrated in the 
    gp_extension/GenericPayloadEndianness unit test, which produces
    host-endian dependent results and therefore is not part of the automated
    regression suite
Additional detail on some of these topics can be found in the users manual.
