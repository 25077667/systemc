1) What's new in this release?
==============================

Compared to the 2.2.0, this release has the following new items:

  - Bug fixes, see next section.
     

2) Bug fixes and enhancements
=============================

Following is the list of bug fixes and enhancements for this release:

     - When sc_stop() is called the message informing the user is now
       issued via SC_REPORT_INFO() rather than just output to cout.
     
     - Fixed bug for sc_bigint::and_reduce() where it was not properly
       detecting the all ones case.

     - Changed the default status value in sc_elab_and_sim() to be 1 
       rather than 0. This means a non-zero value will be returned
       if sc_main() generates an exception.

     - Fixed bug in auto-increment and auto-decrement of sc_signed and
       sc_unsigned values. The original code left the values in sign
       magnitude form and did not properly trim them. The code now uses
       *this = *this + 1 and *this = *this -1

     - Expanded naming of signals in sc_vcd_trace.cpp to use 5 characters
       rather than 3 to accommodate more signals.

     - Fixes for concatenation of sc_int<W> and sc_uint<W> instances.

       src/sysc/datatypes/int/sc_int_base.cpp:

         Changes to sc_int_base::concat_get_data() to fix masks and values
	 that were unsigned long values that should have been unsigned long
	 long values.

       src/sysc/datatypes/int/sc_uint_base.cpp:

         Changes to sc_int_base::concat_get_data() to fix masks and values
	 that were unsigned long values that should have been unsigned long
	 long values.

     - Fix for logical operators between unsigned int and sc_unsigned

       src/sysc/datatypes/int/sc_nbcommon.inc

         Fixed bit width in CLASS_TYPE::CLASS_TYPE() for the case that
	 the signature is a buffer of digits and a width. The value of
	 nbits needs to be set via num_bits() rather than using the
	 nb parameter. This allows the case where CLASS_TYPE is 
	 sc_unsigned to get the proper bit width. Without this fix the
	 high order bit disappears in logical results.

3) New features
===============

Here is an overview of changes in 2.2.1 compared to 2.2.0:

    - None

4) Incompatibilities with previous releases
===========================================

Here is a list of known incompatibilities between this release and 2.2.0:

  - None

5) Fixes to match with the IEEE 1666 SystemC Language Reference Manual
======================================================================

- None


7) Experimental features
========================

In this section the experimental features of this release are listed.

  - None

8) Deprecated features
======================

In this section the deprecated features of this release compared with 
2.2.0 

  - None

9) Known Problems       
=================

  - The use of the DEBUG_SYSTEMC macro does not work properly with certain
    compilers (e.g., gcc 2.95.x) if it was not also specified when the
    SystemC library was built. The problem is caused by the use of the
    library compiled version of some inline methods. This problem does not
    appear to be present in the gcc 3.3, Solaris, and aCC compilers.
    The work-around is to specify DEBUG_SYSTEMC when the SystemC library
    is built.


10) Fixed-point library
=======================

(No change from 2.0.1 Production.)

SystemC contains a fixed-point datatypes package.

Compile-time macro SC_INCLUDE_FX must be defined in order to build
applications that use fixed point types. You can specify a compiler
flag, e.g. g++ -DSC_INCLUDE_FX ... or use a define statement before
you include systemc.h, e.g.

  #define SC_INCLUDE_FX
  #include "systemc.h"

Due to the large size of the fixed-point datatypes header files,
compilation can take considerably more time.

If you want to use the fixed-point data types only (i.e., not data-
types sc_int, sc_uint, sc_bigint, sc_biguint), compilation time can be
reduced by defining compile-time macro SC_FX_EXCLUDE_OTHER (in addition
to SC_INCLUDE_FX).
