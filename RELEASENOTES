1) Supported SystemC versions
=============================

SystemC 2.1.v1 and 2.2.0 are supported and have been tested.


2) What's changed in this kit?
==============================

Compared to the 2.0.0 kit, the following has changed:


a. Added a const modifier to the generic payload methods get_ref_count() and has_mm()

b. Added a const modifier to the phase argument of the notify methods of each of the two PEQs

c. Removed the dependency on the Boost libraries from the code of the multi-socket utilities. The TLM-2 kit now has no dependencies on Boost

d. Changed the implementations of the multi_passthrough_initiator_sockets to provide default implementations for the dmi/debug methods (just like all the other sockets in the tlm_utils)

e. Changed the implementations of the endianness conversion functions so they work correctly on a 64-bit host

f. Fixed bug in simple_target_socket and simple_target_socket_tagged where timing annotation was not acted upon

g. added an example lt_mixed_endian illustrating use of endianness conversion functions to model memory sharing between big- and little-endian initiators

h. Changed constructors of convenience sockets to provide, for each socket, one default constructor and a second one with a name argument (just like standard sockets)

i. Removed references to tlm::tlm_phase in convenience sockets (and replaced them by phase_type)

j. Removed typedefs initiator/target_socket_type from standard sockets

k. Added PTHREADS support in the examples Makefile

l. Cleaned up examples and unit_tests to eliminate issues identified by Doulos and Jeda protocol checkers

For a more detailed description of all features of TLM 2.0 check out the TLM 2.0
manual that can be found in the documentation subdirectory of this package


3) Known issues
===============

a. when using TLM 2.0 with SystemC v2.2.v1 on 64 bit linux you will need to
   force 32 bit mode by using the '-m32' flag

b. the tlm_simple_target_socket in tlm_utils does not obey the END_REQ rule
   when only an nb_ call is registered, an b_ call is being handled in the
   socket and there is an nb_ call coming in at the same time. In this case
   the incoming nb_ call will be forwarded to the registered nb_ call without
   checking whether the earlier b_ call has passed the END_REQ timing point

c. the implementation of the PEQ 'peq_with_get' in tlm_utils does not properly
   distinguish between immediate notifications and delta notifications. In the
   case that a immediate and delta notification happen at the same simulation
   time both types of notifications emerge from the PEQ in the same evaluation
   phase. This is wrong immediate notifications should overtake delta
   notifications

d. FIXED

e. the examples do not successfully 'make check' on bigendian machines, messages
   are not printed correctly in that case.

f. the lt_dmi example does not run for all platform and library versions. It
   works for X86 linux, gcc4.0 and SystemCv2.2.0
