1) Supported SystemC versions
=============================
SystemC 2.1.v1 and 2.2.0 are supported and have been tested.

2) What's changed in this kit?
==============================

Compared to the 2.0.0 kit, the following has changed:

  - stuff here

For a more detailed description of all features of TLM 2.0 check out the TLM 2.0
manual that can be found in the documentation subdirectory of this package

3) Known issues
===============

a. when using TLM 2.0 with SystemC v2.2.v1 on 64 bit linux you will need to 
   force 32 bit mode by using the '-m32' flag

b. the tlm_simple_target_socket in tlm_utils does not obey the END_REQ rule
   when only an nb_ call is registered, an b_ call is being handled in the
   socket and there is an nb_ call coming in at the same time. In this case
   the incoming nb_ call will be forwarded to the registered nb_ call without
   checking whether the earlier b_ call has passed the END_REQ timing point
 
c. the implementation of the PEQ 'peq_with_get' in tlm_utils does not properly
   distinguish between immediate notifications and delta notifications. In the
   case that a immediate and delta notification happen at the same simulation
   time both types of notifications emerge from the PEQ in the same evaluation 
   phase. This is wrong immediate notifications should overtake delta 
   notifications
   
d. the multi_passthrough_initiator_socket and multi_passthrough_target_socket do
   depends on a boost library and does not work with SystemC2.1.v1 due to boost
   incompatibilities

e. the examples do not successfully 'make check' on bigendian machines, messages
   are not printed correctly in that case.
   
f. the lt_dmi example does not run for all platform and library versions. It
   works for X86 linux, gcc4.0 and SystemCv2.2.0
