0003 - /include/tlm_h/tlm_generic_payload/tlm_helpers.h needs to be renamed
       'tlm_gp_helpers.h' or promoted to tlm_core
       [OS]: namespace part is fixed.

0004 - There are variables beginning with underscore characters (_)
       [TW] No specific instances noted - keep an eye out for them.

0016 - I think we need to review the changes in the tlm_core directory from TLM
       1.0 to now. There are quite a few changes, and the question is if we
       really want to have those, or if the changes are only artifacts of the
       draft 1 release that are obsolete now. I don't know.
       [John's addition]: We need to remove the "delayed and annotated
       blocking and non-blocking interfaces" of the TLM2.0-draft1 kit?

0017 - Can we rename the tlm_core directory to something more meaningful?  If I
       understand it correctly, then the tlm_core is supposed to hold the TLM
       1.0 interfaces, which in my mind are not at the core of things for 2.0.

0019 - TLM ports initiator/target ports do not appear to have the GP material
       integrated
