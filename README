                 	       TLM 2.0 
                 =================================

This is the proposed code for the TLM 2.0 standard and is made available for 
OSCI internal review only

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                IMPORTANT

1. This version of the TLM 2.0 standard is a further evolution of draft 2 which
   in itself represents a significant evolution since the draft 1 kit.  
   This version is not, nor was it intended to be, backwards compatible with 
   draft 2 and draft 1.

2. This release has been well tested on the following platforms:
    o Linux (Redhat Enterprise 4) with GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-3.4.4,
      gcc-4.2.0
    To be completed:
    [o Linux (Fedora 6) with GNU C++ compiler version 4.1.2]
    [o Linux (SuSE SLES9SP3) with GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-3.4.4, gcc-4.2.0]
    [o MacOSX with GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-3.1, gcc-3.4.2, and gcc-4.0]
    [o SunOS 5.9, with Sun Forte compiler 8.0, 10.0 and 11.0]
    [o SunOS 5.9, with GNU C++ compiler versions gcc-3.3.2]
    [o Windows XP (SP2) with VC++ 7.0 and 8.0]

   No installation, as such, required; simply extract contents of the
   downloaded package.

Release Notes

   See the separate RELEASENOTES file that provides up-to date
   information about this release of TLM 2.0.

User Documentation

   You can find documentation for this release in the docs directory.  It is
   recommended that you start with the training presentation 
   (TLM_2_0_training.pps) and then the user manual (TLM_2_0_user_manual.pdf).
   See docs/README.txt for a description and status of the other documentation.

Directory Structure

   The TLM kit's directory structure has been patterned after that used 
   for the SystemC language and Verification library (SCV).
   Dirs: include/   : contains the TLM 2.0 standard headers
         unit_test/ : contains a set of tests for TLM 2.0
	 examples/  : contains the examples that come with the TLM 2.0 kit
	 [ to be added: docs]

Build Support
 
   Support for building the examples and unit tests is provided for 'unix', 
   'msvc' (project and make files) and 'cygwin'.

   Makefiles work hierarchically.  Build is the default target; 'clean', 
   'run' (executes built tests/examples) and 'check' (against expected 
   results) targets are also provided.  On Unix/Linux/MacOS, the $TLM_HOME 
   environment variable should be set to this kit's location; $SYSTEMC_HOME 
   and $TARGET_ARCH should be defined such that $SYSTEMC_HOME/lib-$TARGET_ARCH
   is a directory containing the systemc library.  On Windows, the SYSTEMC and
   TLM environments variables should be used.

Examples

   [to be added]

Unit Tests

   The unit tests, though not as complete or documented as the examples, can 
   be illustrative for other features of the kit such as payload extensions, 
   UT & AT modeling, transactors, temporal decoupling, direct memory interface,
   etc.

   See instructions in unit_test/README.txt
