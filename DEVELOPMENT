Development process of the Accellera SystemC implementation
===========================================================
v0.9, September 2012
  Initial proposal to the LWG
:toc:

In this document, the internal development process for Accellera's SystemC
Language Working Group (and TLM Working Group) is described.  This mostly
relates to the development and maintenance procedures for the ASI
proof-of-concept implementation of SystemC (and TLM).  This document
focuses on the technical aspects related to the development of the ASI
SystemC implementation.  Legal and formal procedures are documented at
http://accellera.org.


[[sec:repository]]
Repository organization
-----------------------

The central source code repository of the ASI SystemC implementation is
hosted in two Git [1] repositories at GitHub (http://github.com).  The
repositories are private to the `OSCI-WG` organization and can be found at:

 * http://github.com/OSCI-WG/systemc             (core SystemC library)
 * http://github.com/OSCI-WG/systemc-regressions (regression test suite)

Members of the `OSCI-WG` organization with the necessary access rights can
clone the repositories via SSH from the locations

 * git@github.com:OSCI-WG/systemc.git
 * git@github.com:OSCI-WG/systemc-regressions.git

respectively.  To obtain access to the repositories and the GitHub
organization in general, LWG members can ask the LWG chairs at
(lwg-chair@lists.accellera.org) including their GitHub account information.

Comprehensive documentation about Git [1], a distributed version control
system, can be found in the 'Pro Git' book, available online at [2].  Since
Git is 'distributed', it is a very natural choice for the distributed
development process needed for the collaboratively evolving
proof-of-concept implementation of SystemC.

In order to contribute changes to the different repositories, it is
recommended to create personal (or company-based) forks of the repositories
at GitHub [3] and push the proposed changes (bugfixes, features, ...)
there.  Details of the intended work-flow are described in the next section
(<<sec:branching>>).

[[sec:branching]]
Development flow
----------------

Basic branch setup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main idea is to have two main branches, one for the development,
one for the releases.

master::
    The latest and greatest `HEAD` of the LWG development.
    This is, were all the new features and fixes go.

release::
    This branch is used to create the release tarballs, both
    internal and public snapshots.

For the *regressions*, the `release` branch is more or less just a pointer
to the latest revision of a snapshot (or release).  It is still useful
to keep a named branching point, in case of required hotfixes.

For the *core library*, the `release` branch is be different from the
`master` branch.  The idea is to fully track the contents of the released
tarball.  This means

  - the Automake generated files are added to this tree.
  - ASI internal files are stripped
    (`.gitignore`, internal documentation, ...)

To prepare a release, the `master` branch would then be merged into the
`release` branch, the automake files would be updated (if necessary) and
the clean working tree could be used as baseline for the tarball (e.g.
via `git-archive(1)`).  Details are described in the next section
(<<sec:release>>).

Based on these branches, a development model similar to the well-known
branching model described in [1] can be deployed.  Not all aspects of this
model are needed for the ASI SystemC implementation, as we usually maintain
only a single (i.e. the latest) release of the kernel.

Adding a feature (set)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*TODO*: To be written.

 * use a feature branch for complex contributions
   (named `<company>-<feature-xyz>`, e.g. `<cadence-process-control>`)
 * code up your contribution, push to the feature branch in your fork
   at GitHub
 * send a pull-request (manually or via GitHub)
 * merge feature branch to `master` branch

NOTE: *Commit messages*
  Though not required, itâ€™s a good idea to begin the commit message with a
  single short (less than 50 character) line summarizing the change,
  followed by a blank line and then a more thorough description. Tools that
  turn commits into email, for example, use the first line on the
  `Subject:` line and the rest of the commit in the body.

Tracking release tarballs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to track the release traballs (both LWG-internal and public ones),
a tool named `pristine-tar` [1] is used, a tool which enables to track
archives directly within the repository.

When looking at the branches (e.g. by using `gitk --all`), you may notice
an additional, separate branch called `pristine-tar`.  This branch contains
the metadata for the pristine-tar tool [1].  `pristine-tar` enables
tracking original archives with minimal overhead, since only small binary 
deltas instead of the full tarballs are stored within the repository.

NOTE: Currently, only Linux (and recently Mac OS X) are supported platforms
      for `pristine-tar`.  Porting to Windows (MinGW) is to be done in the
      future, which should be possible to the required extent for the
      use with SystemC.

.Basic workflow
---------------
  # adding an archive
  pristine-tar [-m message] commit systemc-2.3.1.tgz release
  git push origin pristine-tar

  # retrieving an archive
  pristine-tar checkout systemc-2.3.1.tgz
---------------

The maintenance of the `pristine-tar` branch (i.e. adding new archives to
the `pristine-tar` branch) is done by the LWG chairs during the release
management (<<sec:release>>).

Maintaining a private (set of) branches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*TODO*: Outline maintenance of an in-house forking model, seamlessly
        integrated with the LWG's flow.

Vendor's may be interested in maintaining their own, in-house flow
to align the internal development of a derived SystemC implementation,
while being able to pick fixes from the ASI tree (and hopefully)
contributing fixes and features back to the proof-of-concept
implementation.

[[sec:release]]
Release management
------------------

*TODO*: write documentation how to generate release tarballs.

* git checkout release
* git merge    master
* autoreconf -f
* check `git status`, commit new and updated automake files
* git archive

*TODO*: describe tagging policy

Issue tracking
--------------

*TODO*: add issue tracking details

 * Use GitHub issue tracker
 * Define tags for severities and categories
 * Use pull-requests
